# GaussianDreamer Demonstration (CSE252D)

-- By Bhavik Chandna and Isheta Bansal.

This repository presents a **CSE252D course demonstration** of **GaussianDreamer: Fast Generation from Text to 3D Gaussians by Bridging 2D and 3D Diffusion Models**, originally developed by the [HuSVL group](https://github.com/hustvl/GaussianDreamer). It showcases how language prompts can be translated into 3D Gaussian splats using diffusion-based techniques.

## Method Summary

GaussianDreamer embarks on the task of **text-to-3D generation** using a two-stage pipeline:

1. **2D Diffusion Model**: Generates reference views of a 3D scene from a text prompt using a pre-trained image generator like Stable Diffusion.
2. **3D Gaussian Optimization**: Aligns a 3D Gaussian field to match the 2D views using differentiable splatting and novel regularization strategies.

This approach excels in producing coherent, colorful, and structurally plausible 3D assets from simple text inputs.

## How to run code?
## Environment Setup

To run the demonstration, clone this repository and configure your Python environment as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheProParadox/gaussiandreamer-demo.git
cd gaussiandreamer-demo
python3 -m venv cse252d
source cse252d/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code run
Use the following command to run the code: 

```bash
python main.py prompt sample_proportion
```
prompt = prompt as a string 
sample_proportion = value between 0.0 and 1.0 designating how many points to sample from the triangle mesh

Example: !python main.py "a shark" 0.5

All output can be found on the right under the same folder.

There are 5 output files:

"PointClouds.png" - visualization of generated point clouds
"PointCloudsViews.png" - visualization of generated point clouds from different camera angles
"GroundTruthImage.png" - the projected ground truth image in 2d from 3d point clouds
"ground_truth_training_iterations.gif" - gif visualization of 3d gaussian splatting to obtain ground truth image
"diffusion_training_iterations.gif" - gif visualization of optimization with 2d diffusion model
"gaussians_3d.npz" - all parameters of guassian primitive/
"scene_pointcloud.ply" - asset final (can be imported in Blender/SuperSplat/GSplat)

### Note: The code require CUDA (~10GB). Also you may have to increase optimization steps till 20000, I have done it for 1000 to show decent results.
